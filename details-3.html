            <h1>Cream Cheese Pound Cake</h1>
            <!--=======================================-->
            <p>
                This cream cheese vanilla pound cake will have you falling in love with pound cake all over again. The addition of cream cheese makes this cake rich while keeping it moist with a tender crumb. A surprisingly simple and easy recipe that takes just 10 minutes
                to prepare and 40 minutes to bake.
            </p>

            <p>
                I made this cake last year, at a family gathering, and it was such a hit that I've made it a few times since then. In fact, no one believes it is a pound cake because it is so rich and delicious. And, I must admit, I've made many pound cakes over the
                years. But, I've never had so many rave reviews for a cake from friends as I have had for this cake.
            </p>
            <!--=======================================-->
            <h2>Why make this cake?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The recipe is simple and easy using ingredients you probably already have in your pantry, plus cream cheese.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The process is also very simple and standard using the creaming method.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly it is moist and absolutely delicious on its own. So you can serve it right out of the pan.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        And if you don't have cream cheese, make my classic pound cake or chocolate pound cake.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!--=======================================-->
            <h2>Integredients and Substitutes</h2>
            <p>
                Butter - I prefer to use unsalted butter, so I can control the quantity of sugar in my recipe. And yet, if salted butter is all you have, go ahead and use it. Just omit salt in the recipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cream Cheese - In this recipe, cream cheese is calculated as fat. So, you need to use at least 32%, if not more.
            </p>
            <p>
                White Sugar - White sugar contributes to a nice soft tender crumb and gives a nice color. You can also add brown sugar but it will contribute to taste and color differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eggs - Always use large size eggs when baking unless specified. The size of eggs varies significantly these days, so as a guide, one large egg weighs between 50 to 60 grams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vanilla - A good quality vanilla will make a huge difference in anything you make. You can also make your own vanilla extract, bean paste, or sugar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flour - Cake flour gives wonderfully moist cakes with tender crumbs but you can certainly use the same amount of all-purpose flour.
            </p>

            <h2>Step by step instructions</h2>
            <h3>Cake</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 325°F/ 165°C/ Gas Mark 3.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Butter and flour a 6-cup Bundt Pan. You can also use 2 x 6-inch round cake pans.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. And set aside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b class="tip">Pro tip</b> - Sifting the flour will give a light and airy texture to the cake.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Next, add the eggs, one at a time. Then, add the vanilla extract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b class="tip">Pro tip</b> - Ensure the eggs are at room temperature or the batter will curdle. If that happens, just add a tablespoon or two of flour and combine well.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Followed by the flour and buttermilk in three batches.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b class="tip">Pro tip</b> - The batter looks a bit stiffer than regular vanilla cake but do not be tempted to add more milk or the cake might sink.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Scrape the sides of the bowl, ensure you have a smooth batter. Pour into prepared bundt pan. Spread evenly with a spatula. Tap a few times to remove any air pockets.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Bake for 40 to 45 mins until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then invert on a cooling rack and cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/cream-cheese-pound-cake-4.jpg " alt="Steps from 5 to 8 " />
            <h3>Vanila glaze</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, with milk, and other flavorings. Stir until you have a thick pouring consistency. Pour over cooled cake (warm cake will melt the glaze).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Pro tip</b> - You want a thick glaze, so start with less milk then add as necessary to bring to consistency. Slices of pound cake on a plate.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
